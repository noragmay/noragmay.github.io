Nora graduated from Yale University with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering. She has worked in academic research labs at Yale and at UT Austin, which established her affinity for data analysis, and has work published in Energy & Fuels. Previously, she was a research associate at a consulting company that provides capital campaign support to nonprofits and held an intern position at a racial justice and education nonprofit. With her experience and interest in the nonprofit sector, as well as a passion for art and music, she is interested in merging the technical with the humanities: using data to further understand the nebulous and exciting elements of the world we live in.
